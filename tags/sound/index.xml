      <description>Ellen Fullman demonstrating the Water Drip Drum, 1985 These are a few experiments I did in 2022 exploring the rhythmic qualities of dripping taps. I was inspired by the Water Drip Drum made by Ellen Fullman circa 1985. Her design involved a bucket filled with water with several different taps through which the water can drain. Depending on the tightness of the taps, the water drips onto other metal buckets below at certain rates, causing a resonant percussive sound.</description>

The poster produced for the live recording of &amp;#39;The Retoucher&amp;#39; podcast In 2019, I co-developed and produced a science-fiction podcast for BBC Sounds titled The Retoucher in which I used sound as a central world building tool. I used experimental recording methods to rig a club venue with microphones which captured the actors and DJ’s performances in-situ over the course of an evening.
