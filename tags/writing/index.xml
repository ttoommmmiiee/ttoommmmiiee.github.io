      <description>Recently I watched a talk by Eleni Ikoniadou in which she presented her recent work Future Chrous. https://schedule.mozillafestival.org/session/QTHPSU-1
She discussed how in western thinking, speech is often taken as a marker of human inteligence. For Aristottle via Heidegger - man is a political speaking animal, a being who has a language which addresses and discusses its world. For the Greeks, voice without speech was considered irrational and dangerous associated with female, animal, disabled and non-human entities</description>

      <description>In 1997, artist and music producer Terre Thaemlitz released her album Die Roboter under the moniker Rubato. The album comprises piano interpretations of classic Kraftwerk titles. On first listen, the piano rendition sounds like a live performance by a talented and expressive pianist, playing a real piano with rich acoustic tones. The only sonic hint of manipulation is the noise that washes over the piano playing.
