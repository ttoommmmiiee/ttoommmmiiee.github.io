      <description>These are a few experiments I did exploring the rhythmic qualities of dripping taps. I was inspired by the Water Drip Drum made by Ellen Fullman circa 1985. Her design involved a bucket filled with water with several different taps through which the water can drain. Depending on the tightness of the taps, the water drips onto other metal buckets below, causing a resonant percussive sound.
The dripping tap is a classic example of a chaotic system.</description>
