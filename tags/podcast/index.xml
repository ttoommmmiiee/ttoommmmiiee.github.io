      <description>retoucher poster In 2019, I co-developed and produced a science-fiction podcast for BBC Sounds titled The Retoucher in which I used sound as a central world building tool. I used experimental recording methods to rig a club venue with microphones which captured the actors and DJâ€™s performances in-situ over the course of an evening.
In this science-fiction radioplay we follow an employee of Bloom, a pharmaceutical company that has emerged into a globally dominant force, as he stumbles his way to the truth behind their age- reversing drugs.</description>
