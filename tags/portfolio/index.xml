      <description>&amp;lsquo;Womb of things to be and tomb of things that were&amp;rsquo; is a film by Charles Pryor and Marleen Boschen that explores collaborative survival, containment and vulnerability through seeds. Via episodic, speculative storytelling we follow seed banking and saving practices across the globe from the Millennium Seed Bank and the John Innes Centre in the UK, to a forest gene bank in Poland and a food sovereignty organisation in Palestine.</description>

      <description>These are a few experiments I did in 2022 exploring the rhythmic qualities of dripping taps. I was inspired by the Water Drip Drum made by Ellen Fullman circa 1985. Her design involved a bucket filled with water with several different taps through which the water can drain. Depending on the tightness of the taps, the water drips onto other metal buckets below at certain rates, causing a resonant percussive sound.</description>

      <description>In 2019, I collaborated with musicians and artists Beatrice Dillon, Haroon Mirza and, John Butcher &amp;amp; Lasse Marhaug for Somerset House Studiosâ€™ annual ASSEMBLY festival. I developed custom musical tools for each artist using Max/MSP, Wekinator and Touch OSC. The tools enabled the musicians to interface with sound and data from outside the performance venue and work with a large multichannel surround sound setup. https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/assembly-christian-marclay
For ASSEMBLY 2020, I worked with Somerset House Studio to programme a bespoke online platform for presenting 360 spatialised audio in an interactive and immersive format.</description>
