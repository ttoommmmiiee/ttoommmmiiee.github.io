			<p>&lsquo;Womb of things to be and tomb of things that were&rsquo; is a film by Charles Pryor and Marleen Boschen that explores collaborative survival, containment and vulnerability through seeds. Via episodic, speculative storytelling we follow seed banking and saving practices across the globe from the Millennium Seed Bank and the John Innes Centre in the UK, to a forest gene bank in Poland and a food sovereignty organisation in Palestine.</p>

<p>I got involved in the project in February 2019 when Charles and Marleen invited me to the Millennium Seed Bank to record some sounds. It was a fascinating, sterile, industrial place - a far cry from the natural ecosystems it hoped to protect. I recorded crunchy industrial drones produced by the huge freezers using a very nice SoundDevices mixer, Line Audio OM1 omni microphones and some contact mics.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2022-2023, and I worked closely with Charles to produce the sound design and score for the film.</p>
