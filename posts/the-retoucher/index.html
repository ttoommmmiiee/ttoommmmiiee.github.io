<p>In this science-fiction radioplay we follow an employee of Bloom, a pharmaceutical company that has emerged into a globally dominant force, as he stumbles his way to the truth behind their age- reversing drugs. A reflection on emerging technologies, ageing and queer sexuality heard through a collage of improvised performances, live recordings and sound design.</p>
