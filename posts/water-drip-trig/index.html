<p>These are a few experiments I did in 2022 exploring the rhythmic qualities of dripping taps. I was inspired by the <a href="https://youtu.be/0xOq7XOL56g?t=285">Water Drip Drum made by Ellen Fullman</a> circa 1985. Her design involved a bucket filled with water with several different taps through which the water can drain. Depending on the tightness of the taps, the water drips onto other metal buckets below at certain rates, causing a resonant percussive sound. The concept is not too dissimilar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suikinkutsu">Suikinkutsu</a>  &ldquo;a type of Japanese garden ornament and music device. It consists of an upside down buried pot with a hole at the top. Water drips through the hole at the top onto a small pool of water inside of the pot, creating a pleasant splashing sound that rings inside of the pot similar to a bell or Japanese zither.&rdquo; (Wikipedia)</p>
<p>The dripping tap is a classic example of a chaotic system. If you slowly loosen the tap, the dripping transitions from regular periodic drips, to period doubling and chaotic behaviour. I wanted to emulate this behaviour computationally and turned to the physics of a spring as a basic model for achieving this.</p>
<p>I implemented the algorithm in a Max4Live object, P5.js and on a <a href="https://github.com/Allen-Synthesis/EuroPi">EuroPi</a></p>
